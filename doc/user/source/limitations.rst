Limitations
===========

NSX-T plugin cannot be used simultaneously with NSXv plugin
-----------------------------------------------------------

Since both plugins provide the same network component called
``network:neutron:core:nsx`` it is not possible to use both plugins together.


The plugin is not hotpluggable
------------------------------

It is not possible to enable plugin on already existing OpenStack.


Ubuntu cloud archive distribution is not supported
--------------------------------------------------

Fuel 9.0 provides two options for OpenStack release. One is plain Ubuntu
distribution, another one includes Ubuntu cloud archive. The plugin does not
support Ubuntu cloud archive packages.


Ironic service is not supported
-------------------------------

Ironic service requires control of top of rack switches and can not be used
with NSX Transformers.


OpenStack environment reset/deletion
------------------------------------

The Fuel NSX-T plugin does not provide a cleanup mechanism when an OpenStack
environment is reset or deleted. All registered transport nodes, logical
switches and routers remain intact, it is up to the operator to delete them and
free resources.
