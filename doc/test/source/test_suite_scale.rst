core


Steps
#####

    1. Log in to the Fuel with preinstalled NSX-T plugin.
    2. Create a new environment with following parameters:
        * Compute: KVM/QEMU with vCenter
        * Networking: Neutron with NSX-T plugin
        * Storage: default
    3. Add nodes with following roles:
        * Controller
        * Compute
    4. Configure interfaces on nodes.
    5. Configure network settings.
    6. Enable and configure NSX-T plugin.
    7. Configure VMware vCenter Settings. Add vSphere clusters and configure Nova Compute instance on controllers.
    8. Deploy cluster.
    9. Run OSTF.
    10. Launch 1 vcenter instance and 1 nova instance.
    11. Add 2 controller nodes.
    12. Redeploy cluster.
    13. Check that all instances are in place.
    14. Run OSTF.
    15. Delete 2 controller nodes.
    16. Redeploy cluster.
    17. Check that all instances are in place.
    18. Run OSTF.


Expected result
###############

Cluster should be deployed and all OSTF test cases should be passed.

    4. Configure interfaces on nodes.
    5. Configure network settings.
    6. Enable and configure NSX-T plugin.
    7. Deploy cluster.
    8. Run OSTF.
    9. Launch instance.
    10. Add node with compute role.
    11. Redeploy cluster.
    12. Check that all instances are in place.
    13. Run OSTF.
    14. Remove node with compute role from base installation.
    15. Redeploy cluster.
    16. Check that all instances are in place.
    17. Run OSTF.


Expected result
###############

Changing of cluster configuration was successful. Cluster should be deployed and all OSTF test cases should be passed.
