core


Steps
#####

    1. Log in to the Fuel with preinstalled NSX-T plugin.
    2. Create a new environment with following parameters:
        * Compute: KVM/QEMU with vCenter
        * Networking: Neutron with NSX-T plugin
        * Storage: default
    3. Add nodes with following roles:
        * Controller
        * Controller
        * Controller
        * Controller
        * Cinder-vmware
        * Compute-vmware
    4. Configure interfaces on nodes.
    5. Configure network settings.
    6. Enable and configure NSX-T plugin.
    7. Configure VMware vCenter Settings. Add 2 vSphere clusters and configure Nova Compute instances on conrollers and compute-vmware.
    8. Deploy cluster.
    9. Run OSTF.
    10. Launch 1 KVM and 1 vcenter VMs.
    11. Remove node with controller role.
    12. Redeploy cluster.
    13. Check that all instances are in place.
    14. Run OSTF.
    15. Add controller.
    16. Redeploy cluster.
    17. Check that all instances are in place.
    18. Run OSTF.


Expected result
###############

Cluster should be deployed and all OSTF test cases should be passed.

    2. Create a new environment with following parameters:
        * Compute: KVM/QEMU
        * Networking: Neutron with NSX-T plugin
        * Storage: default
        * Additional services: default
    3. Add nodes with following roles:
        * Controller
        * Controller
        * Controller
        * Compute
    4. Configure interfaces on nodes.
    5. Configure network settings.
    6. Enable and configure NSX-T plugin.
    7. Deploy cluster.
    8. Run OSTF.
    9. Launch KVM vm.
    10. Add node with compute role.
    11. Redeploy cluster.
    12. Check that all instances are in place.
    13. Run OSTF.
    14. Remove node with compute role from base installation.
    15. Redeploy cluster.
    16. Check that all instances are in place.
    17. Run OSTF.


Expected result
###############

Changing of cluster configuration was successful. Cluster should be deployed and all OSTF test cases should be passed.
